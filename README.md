# Information Retrieval - Mechanics of Search (Assignment 1)

Overview
This repository contains an implementation of an **Information Retrieval (IR) system** that evaluates various ranking models on the **Cranfield dataset**. The system compares the performance of the following retrieval models:

- **Vector Space Model (VSM)** using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity
- **BM25 Ranking Model**
- **Language Model (LM) with Dirichlet Smoothing**

The effectiveness of these models is measured using **TREC Eval metrics**, such as:
- Mean Average Precision (MAP)
- Precision@5 (P@5)
- Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)
